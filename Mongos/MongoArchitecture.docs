### MongoDB Architecture Diagram

Below is a graphical representation of MongoDB's architecture, illustrating how various components interact within a **Sharded Cluster with Replica Sets**:

```
Clients  --->  mongos  --->  Config Servers
                              |
                              v
       ------------------------------------------------
       |                    |                        |
    Shard 1               Shard 2                  Shard 3
    (Replica Set)         (Replica Set)            (Replica Set)
       |                    |                        |
       v                    v                        v
  Primary -> oplog -----> Secondaries  
  Primary -> oplog -----> Secondaries  
  Primary -> oplog -----> Secondaries  
```

### **Component Breakdown**

#### **1. Clients**

- These are applications or users making queries to the database.
- They send requests for read and write operations.

#### **2. mongos (Query Router)**

- Routes queries from clients to the correct **Shard(s)**.
- Ensures queries reach the appropriate data location based on **shard key**.
- Does **not store data**, only manages routing.

#### **3. Config Servers**

- Stores metadata and sharding configuration.
- Keeps track of which **Shard** holds which part of the data.

#### **4. Shards (Data Storage)**

- Each Shard is a **Replica Set**, providing **high availability** and **failover**.
- Data is distributed across multiple shards.

#### **5. Replica Sets**

- Each Shard consists of multiple **replica nodes**.
- Includes:
  - **Primary Node:** Handles all **write** operations.
  - **Secondary Nodes:** Sync with Primary using **oplog**.
  - **Arbiter (Optional):** Helps in Primary election but does not store data.

#### **6. oplog (Operation Log)**

- Tracks all write operations in the **Primary Node**.
- **Secondaries read from oplog** to maintain consistency.
- Enables **failover**—if the Primary fails, a Secondary with the most recent **oplog entries** becomes the new **Primary**.

### **How It Works**

1. **Clients** send queries to **mongos**.
2. **mongos** checks the **Config Servers** to determine **which Shard** holds the relevant data.
3. Queries are routed to the appropriate **Primary Node**.
4. The **Primary** processes the write request and logs it in **oplog**.
5. **Secondary Nodes** replicate the changes from **oplog**, ensuring consistency.
6. If the **Primary fails**, a **Secondary** takes over using the latest **oplog entries**.

### **Key Benefits of This Architecture**

✔ **Scalability:** Sharding enables horizontal scaling. ✔ **High Availability:** Replica Sets provide redundancy. ✔ **Automatic Failover:** Secondaries take over if a Primary fails. ✔ **Load Balancing:** mongos ensures distributed queries.

This architecture ensures that MongoDB can efficiently handle large-scale distributed databases with **fault tolerance and performance optimization**.
